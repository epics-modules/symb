<H2>VxWorks global symbol table device support</H2>
<P>
Module Owner: <A HREF="mailto:CALionberger@lbl.gov">Carl Lionberger</A></P>

<H3>Overview</H3

<P>VxWorks gives the programmer access to a library of symbol table support
routines and provides a global symbol table which contains all external
variable and function references in the system.  The device support module
described here allow selected record types to read and write variables
referenced by name.  This capability allows EPICS to monitor and influence
VxWorks-runnable code which was written without any knowledge of EPICS; the
code needs only to have its critical variables declared externally, that is,
left non-static outside any function definitions in the usual `C' manner.</P>

<H3>Adding to an application</H3>

<P>IOC applications using this module should add a line like this to their
<CODE>configure/RELEASE</CODE> file.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>SYMB=<i>/path/to/installed/symb</i></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Database Definition file entries for the device support are given in the
installed file <CODE>dbd/symb.dbd</CODE>. This must be linked into the
application with the following entry in an appropriate
<CODE>appInclude.dbd</CODE> file:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>include "symb.dbd"</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The device support routines described below are compiled into a single
object library and installed as <CODE>bin/&lt;arch>/symbLib</CODE>. This file
must be loaded by the IOC, either directly with an entry in the
<CODE>st.cmd</CODE> file like</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>cd symbbin
ld &lt;symbLib</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>or by linking it into an application library with the Makefile command</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>LIBOBJS_vxWorks += $(SYMB_BIN)/symbLib</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P>Device support is provided for most of the standard input and output record
types.  These provide the ability to read and write <CODE>double</CODE> (ai,
ao), <CODE>long</CODE> (bi, bo, mbbi, mbbo, longin, longout), and
<CODE>char&nbsp;*</CODE> (stringin, stringout) variable types.  Waveform
records use the TYPE field to select which variable type to read.</P>

<P>The device type "vxWorks Variable" is defined for each of the above record
types in the <CODE>symb.dbd</CODE> file.  Within a database the name of the
VxWorks symbol desired is obtained one of two ways, depending on whether the
LINK field type is a CONSTANT or INST_IO.</P>

<DL>
<DT>CONSTANT
<DD>The name of the vxWorks global variable is derived from the record
name by stripping off any prefix ending with the first ":" and any
suffix starting with the last ";".  An underscore is automatically
prefixed if required by the particular target architecture.

<P>For example:  "<CODE>ppp:fred;sss</CODE>" refers to the vxWorks global
variable "<CODE>fred</CODE>".</P>

<P>The intention is that the prefix would refer to the IOC and the suffix
would  distinguish references within an IOC.  Suffixes and prefixes are
optional.</P>

</DD>

<P>
<DT>INST_IO
<DD>The string value of the link field is assumed to be of the form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>[ "*" ] name [ "[" index "]" ]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where quoted items are literal and square brackets imply optional items. 
White space is ignored. The leading "*", if specified, implies that the
variable in question is a pointer containing the address of the desired data.
The name is the name of the vxWorks global variable (a leading underscore is
added if required by the target architecture). The optional array index is
multipled by the data element size (e.g. sizeof(char), sizeof(long) or
sizeof(double)) and applied as an offset to the data address.</P>

<P>For example:</P>

<DL>
<DT>DIRECT</DT>
<DD>"<CODE>fred</CODE>" refers to the value of the vxWorks global variable
"<CODE>fred</CODE>"</DD>

<P>
<DT>INDIRECT</DT>
<DD>"<CODE>*fred</CODE>" refers to the value whose address is given in the
vxWorks global pointer "<CODE>fred</CODE>".   The value of the pointer will be
read at run-time rather than initialisation, allowing it to be changed
dynamically.</DD>

<P>
<DT>INDEXED</DT>
<DD>"<CODE>fred[1]</CODE>" states that the vxWorks global variable
"<CODE>fred</CODE>" is an array and refers to its second element</DD>

<P>
<DT>INDIRECT + INDEXED</DT>
<DD>"<CODE>*fred[1]</CODE>" states that the vxWorks global pointer
"<CODE>fred</CODE>" contains the address of an array, and refers to the second
element of that array</DD> </DL>

<P>Note that the interpretation of the "<CODE>*</CODE>" operator is not the
same as in C.  For example, "<CODE>fred</CODE>" and "<CODE>fred[0]</CODE>"
produce the same result, but "<CODE>*fred</CODE>" and "<CODE>fred[0]</CODE>"
are different.</P>

<P>Finally note that strings are not treated any differently from longs or
doubles in that the address returned from this routine is simply the address of
the data. "<CODE>fred</CODE>" is the entire string. "<CODE>fred[2]</CODE>"
starts at the third character of the string.</P>

</DD>
</DL>

<P>Symbol table lookup is performed only at record init time; the resulting
pointer is stored in the DPVT field.  (The indirection, if present, is resolved
at run time.)  If the symbol is not found an illegal NAME field error is posted
and DPVT is set to NULL.  Processing consists of reading or writing the VAL
field using the pointer, unless the pointer is NULL, in which case the device
support module exits immediately.</P>

<P>Other than for the multi-bit raw support no value conversions are performed;
it is assumed that the symbol refers to a variable of the same type as the
record's VAL field.  String operations are restricted to the 40 character size
of the string record VAL fields and null termination is enforced.</P>

<P>No exclusion or interlocking with other code using the referenced variable
is provided, other than locking interrupts while reading or writing the value. 
Synchronization must be provided by the appliation on a case-by-case basis. 
Typically the vxWorks code will poll for its input variables (set by output
record types) and EPICS will poll the code's output variables with suitable
SCAN field values (using input record types).</P>
